# Global Skincare E-Commerce — SQL Analytics Project

This project analyzes a real skincare e-commerce dataset, including product prices, categories, reviews, ratings, and brand performance.  
Using SQL we explore market trends, compare anti-aging vs other skincare categories, identify price patterns, and extract insights about customer preferences.
